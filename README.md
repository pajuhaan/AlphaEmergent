# Alpha Calculation: Fine-Structure Constant from Relator Geometry

This repository provides the code and documentation for calculating the fine-structure constant \( \alpha \) using Relator theory. Unlike traditional methods in quantum electrodynamics (QED), our approach calculates \( \alpha \) through purely geometric relations, derived from the Relator postulate \( R \omega = c \) and a gauge-invariant framework. The key innovation here is that no physical constants like \( e \), \( c \), or \( \hbar \) are neededâ€”only geometric constructs from Relator theory.

The project implements a closed root condition to lock \( \alpha \) by equating a Coulombic shell shift \( DC(\alpha) \) to a vector-induced sector \( G_{\text{ind}}(\Lambda) \), ensuring no fitted constants or empirical parameters.

## Key Features:
- **Emergent \( \alpha \)**: The fine-structure constant is derived as a geometric invariant.
- **No fitted numbers**: All calculations are based on Relator geometry, with no need for measurements of \( e \), \( c \), or \( \hbar \).
- **Precision**: The method produces results with sub-ppt accuracy, matching CODATA 2022's value for \( \alpha \).
- **Fully reproducible**: All calculations are done using arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
