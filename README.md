# Emergent Fine-Structure Constant Calculation


From the Pythagoreans’ hymn to numbers to Feynman’s “1/137” physics has long carried the suspicion that a single ratio ties disparate phenomena together. Sommerfeld introduced the fine-structure constant as a universal coupling , Eddington dared that it should be a pure number, Born framed it as the hidden governor of atomic detail, and Dirac argued that dimensionless combinations like $\alpha$ must be explained by structure rather than units . The riddle endured, acquiring almost mythic overtones—an Ariadne’s thread promised but never found.

In quantum physics, the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ appears almost everywhere, yet its origin remains arguably the field’s most stubborn mystery. After a century of attempts, no first-principles derivation has predicted its value even at the percent level; the rare multi-decimal matches have come from numerology or ad-hoc parameter tuning rather than a physical explanation.

In this paper, I take that challenge literally. I show that $\alpha$ is *emergent and parameter-free*: its value follows from a purely geometric, gauge-invariant construction rooted in the Relator postulate $R\, \omega = c$ (luminal internal evolution on $\mathbb{C}$ orthogonal to spatial winding in $\mathbb{R}^3$). No measured dimensional constants are invoked—no $e$, no $c$, no $\hbar$—and no fitted numbers appear. A closed root condition fixes $\alpha$ by locking a Coulombic shell functional $\mathcal{D}_C$ to the vector-inductive sector through a universal map:

$$
C_{\log} \equiv \frac{\pi^2}{\mathcal{D}_C} \zeta (1 + \zeta) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \zeta = \frac{K}{2\pi^2} \Lambda,
$$

so that the electromagnetic coupling is set by geometry alone. The construction yields rigid, dimensionless ratios between the Coulomb and $\Lambda$-channel sectors. These geometric invariants, not empirical inputs, pin down $\alpha$.

The same mechanism unifies how "time" flows for quantum phases . In a companion analysis, the electron $g$-factor appears as an *evolution-rate shift* of the phase clock induced by the large $\mathcal{D}$ functional on the matching shell—precisely analogous to time dilation in general relativity, whether momentum or gravity-induced, now for the Coulomb field predicted by the Relator  . Thus, the Relator framework does more than produce a number; it provides a single geometric origin for coupling and for evolution-rate renormalization, turning the century-old riddle of $\alpha$ into a calculable constant and opening a concrete path toward band-like stability structures for leptons within a background-free, gauge-invariant setting .

Our closed pipeline predicts an emergent value:

$$
\alpha_{\rm pred} = 0.007297352564326
$$

agreeing with CODATA 2022 $\alpha = 7.2973525643(11) \times 10^{-3}$ to $4.47$ ppt ($z = 0.03 \sigma$), thereby reproducing all certain published digits and predicting subsequent ones.

The numerical outcome—as shown—emerges from a deliberately minimalist formal and computational pathway. While a small background risk of bias toward *overfitting* can never be fully excluded, the relations employed here are grounded in physically meaningful structure and rigorous mathematics rather than ad hoc symbol-play. In principle, the final equation for $\alpha$ can be compressed into a more compact form, but such a reduction strips away its physical content—which I do not advocate.

This repository contains the code to compute the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ as an emergent and parameter-free invariant within Relator theory. The framework solves a closed root equation that couples the Coulombic (scalar) and inductive (vector) channels in a unified C ⊕ R3 geometry. This computation does not rely on any measured constants like $e$, $c$, or $\hbar$, and produces a result matching the CODATA 2022 $\alpha$ value with an extraordinary precision.

The method relies on a geometric and gauge-invariant construction that predicts $\alpha$ without any empirical inputs. It is based on a unique approach to coupling quantum electrodynamics and relativistic mechanics using Relator geometry.

For more details, see the full paper: [**Alpha Paper**](https://zenodo.org/records/16944533).

## Features

* **Precision**: Sub-ppb accuracy matching the CODATA 2022 value of $\alpha$.
* **No Fitted Constants**: The value of $\alpha$ is emergent from geometry, with no empirical tuning.
* **Pure Geometry**: Derived from Relator theory and geometry, offering a novel approach to the fine-structure constant.
* **Self-Contained**: No need for external constants such as $e$, $c$, or $\hbar$.

## How It Works

This framework implements the closed root equation for $\alpha$, coupling the Coulombic and inductive (Λ) sectors. The main steps include:

1. **Coulombic Base Calculation**: Using the scalar channel to compute the baseline for $\alpha$.
2. **Inductive Channel Correction**: Incorporating the effects of the vector channel via a logarithmic correction.
3. **Geometric Closure**: Ensuring the correctness of the derived $\alpha$ by locking the scalar and vector sectors using geometric relations.
4. **Convergence and Precision**: Iterating to convergence, with built-in checks for numerical stability and precision.

## Installation

To run this code, you will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

* `mpmath` (for arbitrary precision arithmetic)
* `numpy` (for mathematical operations)

Install dependencies using pip:

```
pip install mpmath numpy
```

## Usage

After installing the necessary libraries, you can run the code using:

```bash
python "Full Alpha Geometry Calculation.py"
```

The script will compute the emergent $\alpha$ and output the results to the console.
